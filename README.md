# Obsidian Table
Easily manage tables with large amount of text in Obsidian w/o the pain of markdown syntax.

## Motivation
Creating and managing tables in markdown is relatively easy if the table contents are simple. However, tables often contain a large amount of text and working with markdown syntax in such situations is unproductive. 

Among the various approaches to making table management easier, Trey Walli's approach looked reasonable - a compromise between usability and maintaining the original original markdown format. However, the project was abandoned by Trey and I was saddened to see such good work go to waste.

This is my attempt to fix some of the minor quirks and resurrect this project.
